## Business Context
Business Context
Humans are always in search of entertainment and a quick hit of dopamine. Humans are also
quick to become combative in a social media setting. People need to learn not to take
social media so serously.


## Problem Statment
On most social media platforms today, people feel pressure to maintain a curated image, gain followers, and measure their self-worth against likes, comments, and numbers. This seriousness often creates stress, anxiety, and comparison instead of joy. Users are used to platforms that amplify competition and status rather than focusing on fun, lighthearted interaction. Social media spaces are often structured around performance and validation, leaving little room for spontaneity or carefree connection.
There are two problems this platform is focusing on: 1) reducing the pressure of social comparison and 2) creating a space for lighthearted interaction without the burden of image or status.
The solution will seek to address these problems by reimagining social media as a place where connection is rooted in fun, spontaneity, and carefree engagement rather than validation or competition.
