## Business Context
Business Context
Humans are always in search of entertainment and a quick hit of dopamine. Humans are also
quick to become combative in a social media setting. People need to learn not to take
social media so serously.


## Problem Statment
On most social media platforms people feel pressure to keep a specific image and gain followers, and often use it to measure their self-worth. Users taking it too seriously like this can easily find themselves becoming miserable and/or addicted.
There are two problems this platform is focusing on: reducing the seriousness and stress of social media and creating a space for lighthearted interaction without worrying about keeping up an image.
The solution will seek to address these problems by using social media as a place where connection is rooted in fun and carefree engagement rather than competition.
